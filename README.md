# railsbase

This is a Rails template app with the various usual gems pre-installed:

 - [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
 - [Rolify](https://github.com/rolifycommunity/rolify)
 - [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker)
 - [`will_paginate`](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) with [bootstrap support](https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/will_paginate-bootstrap)
 - [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)
 - [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) (with [Charcoal's config](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/metasmoke/blob/master/.rubocop.yml))

Other salient points of note:

 - We're using MySQL as the database; the database config reflects this. You'll need to fill in your own name.
 - Some JS utilities have been included for you; look at `app/javascript/util.js`.
